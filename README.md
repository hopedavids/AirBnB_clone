## Description of the Project
This project is centered on the AirBnB web application from the front-end to the back-end of the application.To have a complete project, there are several phase that needs to be implemented in order to achieve the same functionality.
The entire project will be completed for a period of 4 months and below are the milestone that will be achieved when the project is completed.

## MileStones

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Description of the CommandLine Interpreter

The command-line interpreter is built with the help of the python cmd module. It allows the engineer to have backdoor access to the system for command execution. Below is how to go about with the command-line interpreter:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/hopedavids/AirBnB_clone` and cd into the repository.

2. Run the console.py file `./console.py`

3. You will get the command-line output as this:
```
â–¶./console.py

Backend Interactive Console. Type help or ? to list commands
(hbnb) 
```

4. To find out more information about the console, type `? or help`
```
(hbnb) ?

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 

```
5. Type `quit` to exit the console.
