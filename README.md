# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is centered on the AirBnB web application from the front-end to the back-end of the application.To have a complete project, there are several phase that needs to be implemented in order to achieve the same functionality.
The entire project will be completed for a period of 4 months and below are the milestone that will be achieved when the project is completed.

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
